          Convoy (pre-seed) -> entry point 5.5 Post-Money Val. I recruited a
          senior executive from Square to join as a co-founder. They are about
          to raise at a 5X from tier-1 VCs. I also helped them create their GTM
          strategy.

          Convoy is a marketplace helping SMBs leverage group-buying power to
          compete with larger enterprises. The Convoy Discount Network is a plug
          and play tech solution for SMB hubs including Chambers of Commerce, VC
          portfolios, and trade unions to aggregate and provide discounts from
          and for their members.
        </p>

        <h3>What I liked about the deal:</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Strong Founder-Market Fit: </span>CEO Yasin Abbak
          is a third-time founder with a successful exit under his belt. Yassin
          began his career in finance (JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley) and
          understands commerce, financial markets, and business operations
          extremely well. His father ran and operated a SMB and Yasin is aware
          of the pain points SMB owners face.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Minimal Competition: </span>While there are many
          Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) most organizations do not
          address SMB supply chain inequalities. Additionally, using Chambers of
          Commerce as a GTM wedge is brilliant as Chambers have in-house sales
          teams and networks and this helps keep CAC low.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Strong Synergies: </span>Convoy can provide
          valuable savings to our existing portfolio companies, increasing the
          capital efficiency of our other deployed capital. Convoy’s network as
          it scales opens up opportunities for our SAAS product investments to
          sell and test services directly to SMBs which is otherwise an
          expensive market to reach.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Large and growing TAM: </span>In 2020, the number
          of small businesses in the US reached 31.7 million, making up nearly
          all (99.9 percent) US businesses. This is also representative of the
          sustained growth as it marks a 3.15 percent increase from the previous
          year and a growth of 7.09 percent over the three-year period from 2017
          to 2020. SMBs generate 44% of the US Economy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Proven Pain Point: </span>Small and Medium Size
          Businesses Lose 22% a Year Without Group Purchasing Organization (GPO)
          Buying Power.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Market-ready conditions: </span>Amid the post-COVID
          "new normal," businesses of all sizes are adopting new work patterns
          and innovating to save time, money, and resources. Against this
          backdrop, Convoy arrives with a new purchasing option for many:
          augmenting the group purchasing organization (GPO) supply chain that
          can save SMBs considerable money and keeping costs low. There are not
          too many direct competitors in the market meaning that if Convoy does
          this right they can capture considerable market share.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Strong Capital Efficiency: </span>The company and
          team has made substantial progress given the amount of capital raised
          to date.
